// Table: OCCUPATIONS 
|Column       |TYpe         |
|-------------|-------------|
|name         | varchar     |
|occupation   | varchar     |

//Generate the following two result sets:

-- 1. Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, 
--  immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses).
--  For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).

-- 2. Query the number of occurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:
-- There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.

-- Solution:
(select concat(name,'(',upper(left(OCCUPATION,1)),')') name
from OCCUPATIONS
ORDER BY Name);
(select 
concat ('There are a total of ', count(OCCUPATION),' ', lower(OCCUPATION),'s.' )
from OCCUPATIONS
group by OCCUPATION
order by COUNT(Occupation)ASC , Occupation);
